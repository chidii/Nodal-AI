# Nodal AI

**Modular, production-ready Agent Kit for autonomous PayFi (Payment-Finance) flows on the Stellar Network.**

Nodal AI empowers developers to build autonomous agents capable of handling complex financial interactions. Whether you’re automating cross-border settlements, building machine-to-machine payment gateways, or orchestrating smart contract executions, Nodal AI provides the primitives to do it securely and efficiently on Stellar.

##  Why Nodal AI?

In the era of **PayFi**, payments are no longer just passive transfers they are programmable, autonomous, and integrated into the global financial fabric. Nodal AI bridges the gap between AI reasoning and Stellar's high-speed, low-cost network.

* **Autonomous PayFi:** Built-in support for the `x402` payment standard, enabling seamless machine-to-machine value exchange.
* **Modular Architecture:** Swap in new tools, chain actions, and orchestrate complex workflows without touching core signing logic.
* **Safety-First Design:** Every transaction is simulated via Soroban RPC before broadcast, and all secrets remain strictly externalized.

---

##  Architecture

Nodal AI is built on a clean, three-pillar separation of concerns:

```text
/
├── backend/            # Agent orchestration (TypeScript/Node.js)
├── contracts/          # Soroban smart contracts (Rust)
└── tests/              # E2E & integration tests (Vitest)

```

---

##  Quick Start

1. **Clone & Configure:**
```bash

```



git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodal-ai.git
cd nodal-ai
cp .env.example .env

# Update AGENT_SECRET_KEY, HORIZON_URL, and SOROBAN_RPC_URL

```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
npm install

```

3. **Verify Installation:**
```bash

```



npm run build
npm run test

```

##  Development & Testing

### Backend (TypeScript)
The `backend/` pillar contains the "Agent Brain." Use it to define tools and manage agent state.
*   `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript agent core.

### Smart Contracts (Rust/Soroban)
The `contracts/` pillar holds your escrow and payment logic. 
*   `cd contracts/escrow && cargo test`: Run the suite of Soroban unit tests to ensure contract safety.

### Integration Testing
We use `Vitest` to ensure the entire flow—from AI reasoning to network settlement—works as expected.
*   `npm run test`: Executes the `/tests` suite.
