## Versioning & Release Process

When releasing a new version:

1. Choose a version number following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
2. Create a new section header in this file:
   ```markdown
   ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
   ```
3. Move items from **[Unreleased]** to the new section, organized by:
   - **Added** — new features
   - **Changed** — changes in existing functionality
   - **Deprecated** — soon-to-be removed features
   - **Removed** — removed features
   - **Fixed** — bug fixes
   - **Security** — security fixes and improvements
4. At the bottom of the file, add comparison links (example format shown below)
5. Create a Git tag: `git tag -a v[X.Y.Z] -m "Release version X.Y.Z"`
6. Push the tag: `git push origin v[X.Y.Z]`

### Link Format (Bottom of File)

```markdown
[Unreleased]: https://github.com/your-repo/compare/v[latest]...HEAD
[X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/your-repo/releases/tag/v[X.Y.Z]
```

## Guidelines

- **Be descriptive**: Use clear, user-facing language. Users should understand what changed and why it matters.
- **Group logically**: Use the six standard section types (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security).
- **Link to issues/PRs**: Reference issue numbers and pull requests where applicable (e.g., `(#123)`).
- **Date format**: Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) for release dates.
- **Unreleased section**: Keep the [Unreleased] heading at the top for work-in-progress changes.
